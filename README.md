# Data-Pipeline-Project
This project implements a Data Pipeline for analyzing **loan approval dataset. The script (`data_pipeline.py`) processes loan approval data, handles missing values,incorrect variable types, and out-of-range numerical values and transforms variables.

# Project Structure
- **data_pipeline.py**: Main script for the Data Pipeline.
Divided code into Ingestion and Transformation phases.
- **loanapprovaldatasetbefore**: CSV file containing loan approval data. A continuous dependent variable (loan_amount) and 10 independent variables (continuous, categorical, binary).
       
# Guidelines and Considerations
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Pandas, tqdm, Matplotlib, scikit-learn).
The Data Pipeline follows the guidelines outlined in the project instructions.

# Alerts
- The script provides alerts about the percentage of rows deleted from the total data.

## Additional Data Analysis
In addition to the Data Pipeline, after the data pipeline phase, I utilized Excel to create graphs and pivot table to gain additional insights and Presented it in a presentation.

**Loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution.
