# Data-Pipeline-Project
This project implements a Data Pipeline for analyzing loan data, including an Ingestion phase and a Transformation phase. The script (`data_pipeline.py`) processes loan data, handles missing values, transforms variables, and generates insights.
# Project Structure
- **data_pipeline.py**: Main script for the Data Pipeline.
# Guidelines and Considerations
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Pandas, tqdm, Matplotlib, scikit-learn).
The script adheres to guidelines outlined in the project instructions.
# Alerts
The script provides alerts about the percentage of rows deleted from the total data.
