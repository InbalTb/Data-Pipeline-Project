# Data-Pipeline-Project
This project implements a Data Pipeline for analyzing **loan approval dataset. The script (`data_pipeline.py`) processes loan approval data, handles missing values and transforms variables.

# Project Structure
- **data_pipeline.py**: Main script for the Data Pipeline.
Divided code into Ingestion and Transformation phases.
- **loanapprovaldatasetbefore**: CSV file containing loan approval data. A continuous dependent variable (loan_amount) and 10 independent variables (continuous, categorical, binary).
       
# Guidelines and Considerations
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (Pandas, tqdm, Matplotlib, scikit-learn).
The Data Pipeline follows the guidelines outlined in the project instructions.

# Alerts
- The script provides alerts about the percentage of rows deleted from the total data.
- Handle exceptions for missing values, incorrect variable types, and out-of-range numerical values.

## Additional Data Analysis
In addition to data pipeline, work was done in Excel and presentation of the insights in a PPT presentation in accordance with additional instructions for the project:
1. **Linear Relationships:** Check the linear relationship between each independent variable and the dependent variable.
2. **Relationship Between Variables:** Check the relationship between each independent variable and other variables.
3. **Pivot Table and Graphs:**
   - Produce a Pivot Table for each independent variable with the dependent variable.
   - Create suitable graphs according to variable types.    
4. **Generate Insights:** Generate initial insights/hypotheses from the data. For Example:![image](https://github.com/InbalTb/Data-Pipeline-Project/assets/132600292/31d37cda-8e8d-48cf-8080-203d643817b6)

**Loan approval dataset is a collection of financial records and associated information used to determine the eligibility of individuals or organizations for obtaining loans from a lending institution.
